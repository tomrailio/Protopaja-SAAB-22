// ATM all the key code is in the "The Death Star" file. Once the Antenna arrives, we will finish this function. 
// The basic libraries will be installed already in the Arduino IDE, there may need not be any need to include
// any additional libraries into the code. 

#include <WiFi.h>                  This seems most relevant ATM, but this library was retired and is no longer maintained.
                                   This library is compatible with all architectures so you should be able to use it on all the Arduino boards.   
                                   This library is automatically “installed” when you install the ESP32 add-on in your Arduino IDE.
// #include <SPI.h>                This seems irrelevant ATM for our Use Case. 
                                   Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial data protocol used by 
                                   Microcontrollers for communicating with one or more peripheral devices quickly over short 
                                   distances. It can also be used for communication between two microcontrollers.
                                   With an SPI connection there is always one Controller device (usually a microcontroller) 
                                   which controls the peripheral devices. Typically there are three lines common to all the devices:
                                   Controller In, Peripheral Out (CIPO) - The Peripheral line for sending data to the Controller,
                                   Controller Out Peripheral In (COPI) - The Controller line for sending data to the Peripherals,
                                   Serial Clock (SCK) - The clock pulses which synchronize data transmission generated by the 
                                   Controller, and Chip Select pin (CS) - allocated on each device which the Controller 
                                   can use to enable and disable specific devices and avoid false transmissions due to line noise.
 

// TODO's below: 
// Unlike TCP sockets connection between the server and its clients, or webSockets upon HTTP, we do not require ACK,
   but we still need to have some sort of valid verification method.

  Serial.begin(9600);              // initialize serial communication
  pinMode(0, INPUT_PULLUP);        // initialize encoder pins

     WiFi.begin                    // try to connect, if ACK returned from RX. --> NOT required!
     delay(2000);                  // We stay inside the loop, until being connected.
