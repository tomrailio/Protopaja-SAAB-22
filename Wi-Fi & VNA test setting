ESP32 Wi-Fi Modes
The ESP32 board can act as Wi-Fi Station, Access Point or both. 
To set the Wi-Fi mode, use WiFi.mode() and set the desired mode as argument:

WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA)	station mode: the ESP32 connects to an access point
WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP)	access point mode: stations can connect to the ESP32
WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA_AP)	access point and a station connected to another access point
