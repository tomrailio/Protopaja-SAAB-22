Power On->ATMEGA 328P:When the power is being turned on,\nthen the microcontroller is powered
ATMEGA 328P->ATMEGA LED:The LED connected to the micro-\ncontroller is powered on
Synthesizer<--ATMEGA LED

ATMEGA 328P->Synthesizer:The synthesizer registers are loaded\nwith values from the microcontroller\n
Synthesizer->RF Amplifier:The 2.4GHz signal in the form of a sine wave\nis generated and sent to the amplifier
RF Amplifier->(3)Antenna
Power On->Synthesizer:The synthesizer is powered\n
Synthesizer->Synthesizer LED: The LED connected to the \nsynthesizer is powered on
RF Amplifier->Antenna:The amplified signal is sent to the antenna\nand transmitted to the environment
