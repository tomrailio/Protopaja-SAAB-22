1. OVERVIEW 

This document provides the specifications of SAAB microwave transmitter, which can transmit 
waves with a determined frequency of 2-10 GHz with the power of under 20 dBm EIRP.
 
1.1. Featured Solution

This handheld device is capable of transmitting the sine waves to one selected direction. 
The transmitter is a testing tool for the SAAB Sirius radar system and the final prototype 
is compatible with Sirius. The transmitter is designed for rough Arctic environments, taking
advantage of ESP32 low-duty cycle used to minimize the amount of energy that the chip expends.

ESP32’s digital pins are divided into three different power domains:
• VDD3P3_RTC
• VDD3P3_CPU
• VDD_SDIO
VDD3P3_RTC is also the input power supply for RTC and CPU.
VDD3P3_CPU is also the input power supply for CPU.
VDD_SDIO connects to the output of an internal LDO whose input is VDD3P3_RTC. 
When VDD_SDIO is connected to the same PCB net together with VDD3P3_RTC, the internal 
LDO is disabled automatically. The power scheme diagram is shown below:
  
- SDIO Domain
- RTC Domain
- CPU Domain
