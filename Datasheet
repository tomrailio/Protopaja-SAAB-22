1. OVERVIEW 

This document provides the specifications of SAAB microwave transmitter, which can transmit 
waves with a determined frequency of 2-10 GHz with the power of under 20 dBm EIRP.
 
1.1. Featured Solution

This handheld device is capable of transmitting the sine waves to one selected direction. 
The transmitter is a testing tool for the SAAB Sirius radar system and the final prototype 
is compatible with Sirius. The transmitter is designed for rough Arctic environments, taking
advantage of ESP32 low-duty cycle used to minimize the amount of energy that the chip expends.
