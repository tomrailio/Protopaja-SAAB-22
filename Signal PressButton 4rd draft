// TODO's below: 
// Unlike TCP sockets connection between the server and its clients, or webSockets upon HTTP, we do not require ACK!,
   but we still need to have some sort of valid verification method. The Spectrum Analyzer, oscillator and detector will
   be applied where applicable, but not the VNA.
