Measurement of microwave signal.

Introduction

In this project, we aim to communicate with the SAAB Sirius receiver (RX) with microwaves. 
Our project has two parts: ironside and software side. The microwave transmitter (TX), which
modulates the sine signal wave and programme that enables the signal aiming with a pressbutton.

We expect to have a fully working microwave transmitter, which can transmit waves with 
a determined frequency within the 2-10 GHz range with the power of under 20 dBm EIRP. 
The device should be handheld and capable of transmitting the waves to one selected direction. 
The transmitter is made to be used as a testing tool for the Sirius radar system and 
the final prototype is expected to be compatible with Sirius. 

The receiver is a black-box in the sense, that we do not know how it has been configured. 
At this stage, we do not know, if receiver uses an amplifier to amplify the signal from the
microwave transmitter. The schematics and board layout of the receiver is unknown. 

The determination of amplitude and modulation seems worthwhile to evaluate a bit further. Oscilloscope 
can be used also for frequency stability, bandwidth, output power stability, power consumption
and bus analyses. Spectrum Analyzer will be used to measure the power as a function of frequency.
Detector (powermeter) helps us to monitor when rf power is transformed into voltage. These measurements
enable us to also verify the transmission (NFR reliability), as we are not monitoring any ACKs. 

The synthesis of measurement results will be integrated into the Datasheet, when completed. 

Next is a brief outline, how we eneded up measuring the signal range of the antenna with 
a spectrum analyzer'.
