This file lists all the detected problems we have found out during the development process and some solutions to fix them:

1.) Sine wave applied, no need for wifi library. 

2.) No carbonbased PLA near the antenna as signal distortortions might occur. 

3.)  Our initial plan for the antenna was to have a metal reflector plate to redirect the signal, but this idea 
was discarded due to concerns over signal distortion and resulting in inconsistent EIRP levels.
