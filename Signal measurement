Introduction

In this project, we aim to communicate with the SAAB Sirius receiver (RX) with microwaves. 
Our project has two parts: ironside and software side. The microwave transmitter (TX), which
modulates the signal wave and programme that enables the signal aiming with a pressbutton.

We expect to have a fully working microwave transmitter, which can transmit waves with 
a determined frequency of 2-10 GHz with the power of under 20 dBm EIRP. The device should be 
handheld and capable of transmitting the waves to one selected direction. The transmitter is 
made to be used as a testing tool for the Sirius radar system and the final prototype is 
expected to be compatible with Sirius.
