WiFi
Communication

Enables network connection (local and Internet) using the Arduino WiFi shield.
With this library you can instantiate Servers, Clients and send/receive UDP packets 
through WiFi. The shield can connect either to open or encrypted networks (WEP, WPA). 
The IP address can be assigned statically or through a DHCP. The library can also manage DNS.

Note: this library was retired and is no longer maintained !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Compatibility
This library is compatible with all architectures so you should be able to use it on all the Arduino boards.

Releases
To use this library, open the Library Manager in the Arduino IDE and install it from there.

1.2.7 (latest)
1.2.6
1.2.5
1.2.4
1.2.3
1.2.2
1.2.1
1.2.0
Usage
The firmware for the WiFi shield has changed in Arduino IDE 1.0.5. You are recommended to install 
this update per these instructions

With the Arduino WiFi Shield, this library allows an Arduino board to connect to the internet. 
It can serve as either a server accepting incoming connections or a client making outgoing ones. 
The library supports WEP and WPA2 Personal encryption, but not WPA2 Enterprise. Also note, 
if the SSID is not broadcast, the shield cannot connect.

Arduino communicates with the WiFi shield using the SPI bus. This is on digital pins 11, 12, and 13 
on the Uno and pins 50, 51, and 52 on the Mega. On both boards, pin 10 is used as SS. On the Mega, 
the hardware SS pin, 53, is not used but it must be kept as an output or the SPI interface wonâ€™t work. 
Digital pin 7 is used as a handshake pin between the Wifi shield and the Arduino, and should not be used.

The WiFi library is very similar to the Ethernet library, and many of the function calls are the same.

For additional information on the WiFi shield, see the Getting Started page and the WiFi shield hardware page.

To use this library:

#include <WiFi.h>
